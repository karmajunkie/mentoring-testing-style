Mentoring Testing Style
=======================

This is a small project designed to illustrate concepts involved with testing.
It was presented to university students in a 20 minute session.


Navigating Source Code
----------------------

This project is tailored for IntelliJ's IDEA IDE [5], which this project was
developed with.  Setting up IDEs, though, is a real chore.  For learning, just
navigate the project with your favorite text editor.

You'll find all the source for both the main projects in the src/.  The systems
under test are under src/main/.  And the tests are under src/test/.

There are two systems under test:

    - a NumberWords java class that converts numbers to English representations

    - a tic tac toe game implementation

Requirements
------------

Most of the code in this project is straight Java, but a small amount of test
code is written in Scala.  Because of the Scala code, I've chosen to use Simple
Build Tool (SBT) [1] to manage the build process.  So to build and run the
tests in this project, you'll need two applications.

    - Java SE JDK 6 (or higher) [2 or 3]
    - SBT launcher jar v0.7.5.RC0 (or higher) [4]

[3] if you're on a Debian-based OS: apt-get install sun-java5-jdk

Running Tests
-------------

After installing the JDK and saving the SBT launcher somewhere you can run all
the tests with a simple command:

    java -jar $PATH_TO_SBT_LAUNCHER_JAR update test

You'll see a lot of stuff fly, and if everything goes well the last line
printed should be

    [success] Build completed successfully.

If you scroll up, you should see some reporting for all the tests.


A Little About SBT
------------------

The SBT launcher jar is a bootstrap application that goes out to the internet
and downloads everything you really need.  These downloads end up in two
places:

    - in the project itself under lib_managed/ and project/

    - in $HOME/.ivy2/

The SBT invocation above runs two actions: 'update' and 'test'.  The update
action grabs things from the internet.  The 'test' action performs all the
compilation necessary and runs then all the tests.

Compiled Java classes end up in the target/ directory.  You can run a 'clean'
action, which more or less just recursively deletes target/.  There are a lot
of other actions; use the 'actions' action to get a listing.

Running SBT can appear slow because the JVM takes a lot of time to startup.  To
get around this problem you can run SBT with no actions and SBT will run as an
interactive shell, keeping the JVM warm and running in the background.

That should be enough information to demystify SBT.  SBT is an interesting
tool, and you can learn more from the official documentation [6].
